    <h1>SCP Challenges</h1>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/stephanpieterse/scp">source</a> for all the challenges is publically available, but it's more fun to complete the challenge first!
    </p>
    <p>
        To download the challenge, go to the <a href="https://github.com/stephanpieterse/scp/releases">releases page</a>
        and then select the puzzle built for the OS relevant to you. On Linux and OSX, you may need to run <span class="code">chmod +x`</span> on the binary before running it. <br/>
        You are welcome to build the challenges yourself if you don't trust random code. <br/>
        The apps are local servers, which will log which port they are listening on.
